                    <p class="mb-3 par">COVID-19 has caused unprecedented and sudden changes in daily life, and urban crime has also undergone tremendous changes under its influence. At the community level, Campedelli et al. studied the city of Chicago by comparing crime data before and after the pandemic and combined it with community demographic characteristics. They found that the city’s crime trends have changed dramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic, although the pandemic has reduced the overall crime rate, some crimes that did not occur frequently before the pandemic have increased under the influence of the pandemic. The study found two abnormal crime trends. The first is in areas where young people and the elderly account for a large proportion of the community’s population. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the crime rate has increased significantly, followed by the gradual decline in the crime rate in communities with high housing vacancy rates.<br>
                        <br>
                    The study analyzed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on different types of crime. However, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the temporal and spatial distribution of urban crime is unclear, especially the impact of urban physical characteristics on urban crime during the pandemic. Therefore, the goal of this study is to use past research methods on the temporal and spatial distribution of urban crime, combined with Campedelli's research to compare the changes in Buffalo's crime trends before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. We hope that this study can provide constructive suggestions for local police departments or authorities to allocate available resources to respond to crimes. The pandemic is devastating, but there are also opportunities to better understand social processes, including those that lead to the level of crime in the city.

                        <li>The vehicle theft case was not affected by short-term events (such as George Floyd protests), which caused significant fluctuations on a certain day.
                        </li>
                        <li>The stay-at-home order had a beneficial effect on the theft of vehicles in Buffalo.
                        </li>
                        <li>Vehicle theft has shifted in time. Vehicle theft is now mainly concentrated in the daytime, and the peak of crime was detected on Tuesday and Thursday.
                        </li>
                        <li>The spatial distribution of vehicle theft has also changed dramatically, and the spatial cluster of vehicle theft in Buffalo disappeared near the city center.
                        </li>
                        <li>The increase in vehicle theft is related to the proportion of mixed land, commercial land, and vacant land in the area in the Block Group.
                        </li>
                        <li>The increase in the proportion of residential land, the proportion of unemployed, and the degree of congestion are related to the decrease in vehicle theft.
                        </li>
                        <li>The research results can help us further understand the changes in crime patterns in the post-epidemic era. In addition, Buffalo City's law enforcement agencies can adjust their security patrol strategies in a timely manner based on the results.
